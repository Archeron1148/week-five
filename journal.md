week five reflection
    -Archeron1148

>discuss the space between the action of counting, and the reality of the things that have been counted. In what ways does the coding scheme from debs.ac.uk miss, elide, or highlight memorialization practice in Canadian graveyards?... Begin the reflection by quoting (w/ citation) one sentence from the readings that resonates with you

"Because many archaeological methods are destructive, databases serve asimportant  archives  of  former  states  of  being." -Ontologies of the Future and Interfaces for All: Archaeological Databases for the Twenty-First Century, Angela  M.  Labrador

I would argue that (and potentially this is part of what Labrador was getting at) even after being pulled out of the ground and examined and exposed to the elements, artifacts go through yet another destruction when they are entered into database systems (esspecially computerized ones): as a fact (i.e.: as a real observed historical phenomenon), they are abstracted, reduced from their real material state into the realm of pure data, and stripped of all properties that don't fit into the system's 'schema.' At this stage, the system's encoded assumptions about data become transformed into real observed generalities of the recorded aritfacts (that is, assuming that researchers don't take a critical eye to this data). For this reason, I think one of the most important things to include in any archaeological digital database should be images (and crucially, the ability to add more than one), which I think can, for a lot of artifacts, preserve much of the nuance that gets stripped away through digitization. The kobotoolbox form we used in the graveyard project had a very important flaw for me in that it only allowed a user to upload one image per memorial, which is an issue when one considers that some gravestones have writing on more than one face - not to mention three, which is a phenomenon impossible to capture in a single 2D image. The DEBS project coding scheme also had quite a few other issues in the assumptions it makes about the data which I mentioned already in week 2: for example, that the denomination codes only included abrahamic religions and no code for 'unknown' or 'non-religious.' I myself found a couple of stones that I could not identify exactly as any of the shapes listed on the code sheet. Also, as others have already mentioned in annotations on "what gets counted, counts", the binary male or female radio button on the kobotoolbox form for recording individuals really ought to be critically re-examined.

(I did not get to doing any of the practical work this week, but I'll make sure to add my comments on it to week six's reflection)
