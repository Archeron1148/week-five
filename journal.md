week five reflection
-Archeron1148

>discuss the space between the action of counting, and the reality of the things that have been counted. In what ways does the coding scheme from debs.ac.uk miss, elide, or highlight memorialization practice in Canadian graveyards?... Begin the reflection by quoting (w/ citation) one sentence from the readings that resonates with you

"Because many archaeological methods are destructive, databases serve asimportant  archives  of  former  states  of  being." -Ontologies of the Future and Interfaces for All: Archaeological Databases for the Twenty-First Century, Angela  M.  Labrador

I would argue that (and potentially this is part of what Labrador was getting at) even after being pulled out of the ground and examined and exposed to the elements, artifacts go through yet another destruction when they are entered into database systems (esspecially computerized ones): as a fact (i.e.: as a real observed historical phenomenon), they are abstracted, reduced from their real material state into the realm of pure data, and stripped of all properties that don't fit into the system's 'schema.' At this stage, the system's encoded assumptions about data become transformed into observed generalities of the recorded aritfacts (that is, assuming future reasearchers don't take a critical eye to this data).
